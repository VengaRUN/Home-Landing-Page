      "Hey there,",
      "I’ve lived here for 21 years. That’s long enough to know what makes a place feel like home, and longer than most people stay in one spot. So why did I? Simple.",
      "This place gives you something that’s hard to find and even harder to let go of: peace.",
      "Not peace in the metaphorical, yoga-on-a-mountain sense (although that’s definitely possible here). I’m talking about real, bone-deep, roll-your-shoulders-down peace. The kind that comes from silence, not the eerie kind, but the kind filled with birdsong, rustling leaves, and wind across the trees.",
      "No road noise. No construction. No sirens. Just nature doing its thing.",
      "I know when people tour homes, it’s easy to focus on the cosmetic stuff. Cabinets. Tile. Fixtures. You can swap out any of those. But you can’t build privacy, or buy quiet, or create a Milky Way sky in your backyard.",
      "This isn’t just a house, it’s a quality-of-life decision. And if that’s what you’re after, I hope you feel it here the way I have.",
      "Welcome home,",
